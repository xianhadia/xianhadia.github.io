I am a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology advised by [RaphaÃ«l Pestourie](https://www.raphaelpestourie.com/). My research is on modeling, simulation, and design within optics. More specifically, my research centers on developing computational tools and simulation techniques to model how light interact with complex media. Ultimately, I wish to design with the ultimate goal of designing devices - such as lenses, waveguides, metamaterials, etc. Click at the top to access the drop-down menu for my blogs on physics, math, and engineering as well as my curriculum vitae.

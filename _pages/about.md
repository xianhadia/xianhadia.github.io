(⚠️ Site still under construction ⚠️)

I am a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology advised by [Raphaël Pestourie](https://www.raphaelpestourie.com/). My research is on modeling, simulation, and design within optics. 

More specifically, I study partial differential equation (PDE)-based system. I have particular interest of these systems within the field of electromagnetism. My work centers on developing computational tools and simulation techniques to model how electromagnetic waves interact with complex media. Ultimately, I wish to design with the ultimate goal of designing devices. Examples of these devices are lenses, waveguides, and antennas.

I specialize in the design and optimization of metasurfaces—especially metalenses. My research draws upon techniques from 

Briefly my research on the modeling, simulation, and design within optics. More verbosely, my research is on the modeling and simulation of partial different equation (PDE) based systems, particularly within electromagnetism, with the end goal of designing devices - such as lenses, waveguides, etc. Most of my expertise is within the design of metalenses and topology of waveguides.

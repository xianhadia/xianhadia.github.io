I am a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology advised by [RaphaÃ«l Pestourie](https://www.raphaelpestourie.com/). My research is on modeling, simulation, and design within optics. 

More specifically, I study partial differential equation (PDE)-based system. I have particular interest of these systems within the field of electromagnetism. My work centers on developing computational tools and simulation techniques to model how electromagnetic waves interact with complex media. Ultimately, I wish to design with the ultimate goal of designing devices - such as lenses, waveguides, metamaterials, etc.

I'll revise the table to remove the boxes from the equations.

I've removed the boxes from the equations in the Maxwell's Equations summary table as requested. The equations now appear without the `\boxed{}` command, which gives them a cleaner look in the table format while still maintaining their mathematical clarity.

The table now presents the four Maxwell's equations in both differential and integral forms without boxes, while still preserving the structure and information about each law's physical meaning.

Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the formatting of the equations or table?
